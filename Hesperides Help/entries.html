<h1>How to read entries</h1>
<h2>Main entries</h2>
 
<p>Each word is given with its attested variants between 
parenthesis, its inflected forms (plural for a noun, past tense for a verb, 
etc.), its grammatical role and its definition. The following diamond symbol 
(&#9671;) introduces the textual references (books and pages where the word 
occurs -- in the case of deduced entries, references are introduced by an arrow 
(&#8592;), see below.</p>

<p id="cair" class="sindict">
  
    <span class="entry"><b>cair</b></span>* 
    k&#712;&#593;jr
    (
      <span class="form"><b>ceir</b></span> 
    )
  
  
    <small><i>n.</i></small>
  
   
    
      ship
    
  
  
      &#9671; <small>Ety/365, LotR/A(iv), X/EI</small>
  
  &#9671; <small>MS *keir, OS *kiria (KIR)</small>
</p>

<p>Words immediately followed by a star&nbsp;(*) are attested in 
Sindarin (in that case, see Cair Andros in the Lord of the Rings, 
appendix&nbsp;A). A word without this sign is attested in "Noldorin" dialect only 
(most probably in The Etymologies). When both forms are known, searching for 
the "Noldorin" word is always possible, and returns a link to the main 
entry.</p>
 
<p id="ceir" class="sindict">
  
    <span class="entry"><b>ceir</b></span> 
  
  &#8594; <b><a href="?cair">cair</a></b>
</p>

<p>Likewise, inflected forms are linked to the actual word: </p>

<p id="edain" class="sindict">
  
    <span class="entry"><b>edain</b></span>* 
    <small><i>pl.</i></small>
  
  <small><i>of</i></small> <b><a href="?adan">adan</a></b>
</p>
 
<h2>Etymologies</h2> 
 
<p>David Salo's etymological reconstructions are introduced 
by another diamond (&#9671;) diamond. David has spent much of his time understanding 
how Sindarin words are derived from Common Elvish. These notes try to extend Tolkien's 
ever changing rules, providing consistent and understandable etymologies.</p>

<h2>Related entries</h2>

<p>
The full diamond&nbsp;(&#9672;) introduces a list of related words, for instance inflected 
forms of the headword. Each related entry is given with its grammatical role 
(part of speech). Assuming that you search for <span style="font-weight:bold">ava-</span>, you will get the 
following result:</p>
 
<p id="ava-" class="sindict">
  
    <span class="entry"><b>ava-</b></span>* 
    &#712;&#593;v&#593;
  
  
    <small><i>aux.</i></small>
  
   
    
      will not
    
  
  
  &#9671; <small>OS *aba (ABA)</small>
  &#9672; 
      <span class="re"><b>avad</b></span>* 
    
      <small><i>ger.</i></small>
    
  &#9672; 
      <span class="re"><b>avo</b></span>* 
    
      <small><i>v.</i></small> <small><i>imp.</i></small>
    
  &#9672; 
      <span class="re"><b>avon</b></span>* 
    
      <small><i>v.</i></small> <small><i>1st</i></small>
    
  &#9672; 
      <span class="re"><b>avam</b></span>* 
    
      <small><i>v.</i></small> <small><i>1st</i></small> <small><i>pl.</i></small>
    
</p>

<h2>Homonyms</h2> 
 
<p>When several words with the same orthography exist 
in the dictionary, they are numbered:</p>
 
<p id="aer.1" class="sindict">
  
    <span class="entry"><b>aer</b></span>*  <b><font face="helvetica" color="#cc0000">I</font></b>
    [&#712;&#593;&#603;r]

  
  
    <small><i>n.</i></small>
  
   
    
      sea
    
  
  
      &#9672; <small>Tolkien changed this word several times, see <b><a href="?aear">aear</a></b>, <b><a href="?gaear">gaear</a></b></small>
  
  &#9671; <small>OS *aire (ÁJ-AR)</small>
</p><p id="aer.2" class="sindict">
  
    <span class="entry"><b>aer</b></span>*  <b><font face="helvetica" color="#cc0000">II</font></b>
    [&#712;&#593;&#603;r]

  
  
    <small><i>adj.</i></small>
  
   
    
      holy
    
  
  
      &#9671; <small>VT/44:21,24</small>
</p>

<h2>Deduced entries</h2>
 
<p>A few words in the dictionary are actually not attested 
in full form in Tolkien's writings, but may be deduced from place names 
or inflected forms occurring in a Sindarin text. In that case, they are printed 
in italic:</p>
 
<p id="cast" class="sindict">
  
    <span class="entry"><i><b>cast</b></i></span>* 
    [k&#712;&#593;st]

  
  
    <small><i>n.</i></small>
  
   
    
      cape, headland
    
  
  
      &#8592; <small><i>Angast</i> VT/42:28</small>
</p>

 
<h2>Probable misreadings</h2>
 
<p>Tolkien's handwriting is sometimes difficult to decipher. 
Several probable errors have been corrected in the dictionary (such as <span style="font-weight:bold">hamma</span> for 
<span style="font-weight:bold">hamnia</span>), according to our understanding of the Sindarin phonology. However, 
Christopher Tolkien's original reading is always mentioned after the corrected word:</p> 

<p id="hamma-" class="sindict">
  
    <span class="entry"><b>hamma-</b></span> (<small><i>corr.</i> </small><font color="#777777">hamnia</font>)
 
    [h&#712;&#593;mm&#593;]

  
  
    <small><i>v.</i></small>
  
   
    
      to clothe
    
  
  
      &#9671; <small>Ety/363</small>
  
  &#9671; <small>OS *k&#688;amp&#688;a- (KHAP)</small>
  &#9672; 
      <span class="re"><b>hammad</b></span> 
    
      <small><i>ger.</i></small>
    
</p>


<h2>Coined words</h2>
 
<p>A few words not invented by Tolkien himself, but occur in Peter Jackson's 
movie adaptation or later texts by Tolkien's fans. They are included for discussion and reference. 
They are marked as deduced (italic) and are followed by a dagger sign (&#8224;).</p>

<p id="gûd" class="sindict">
  
    <span class="entry"><i><b>gûd</b></i></span>&#8224; 
  
  
    <small><i>n.</i></small>
  
   
    
      foe
