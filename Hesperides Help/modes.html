<h1>Modes</h1>

<h2>What are modes ?</h2>

<p>
A mode is a component of Hesperides which explains how to different
sounds are rendered in Tengwar. Sindarin and English, for example, are
differently rendered in Tengwar.
</p>

<p>
Please remember that automated transcription is not always perfect, and that it sometimes fails to render some of the subtleties of J.R.R. Tolkien's writing system.
</p>

<p>
If you just want to transcribe Sindarin words, Hesperides includes two modes
which are perfectly fit for the task ; the default settings will just
work fine, but it you want to know what these modes are, read on.
</p>

<h2>Sindarin and Sindarin Classic</h2> 

<p>
These modes are the two modes included in Hesperides.
<emph>Sindarin</emph> was designed by Måns Björkman and is the mode used 
on the picture of the Doors of Moria included in the Lord of the Rings.
<emph>Sindarin Classic</emph> was designed by René Vega and is the one
used in the third version of the King's letter to Samwise Gamgee (found
in the History of the Lord of the Rings, for example). It represents
what men of Gondor would have written when trying to write Sindarin.
</p>

<h2>Other modes</h2>
<p>
Hesperides can use all the modes fit for Tengwar Scribe, a Windows
transcription application. You can use, for example, all the modes
<a href="http://hem.passagen.se/mansb/at/tengscribe.htm">here</a> :
just download the mode file, go to your Library folder (in your home directory),
and open the Application Support folder ; drop the mode file in the
Hesperides directory.
