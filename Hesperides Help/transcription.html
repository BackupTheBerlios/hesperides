<h1>How do I use the transcription feature ?</h1>

<p>
Sindarin is usually written using Tengwar - the letters devised
by Rúmil and improved by Fëanor. Hesperides automatically
displays the Sindarin words using Tengwar thanks to the Narmacil engine,
by BLiZZARD. Hesperides also offers a system service to transcribe words to Tengwar.
</p>

<p>
To transcribe words using Tengwar, Hesperides needs a mode.
If you don't know what that is, or if you want to transcribe
non-Sindarin words, you may want to get <a href="modes.html">more information about modes</a>.
</p>

<h2>How can I transcribe other texts ?</h2>

<p>Just type your text in another application, like TextEdit, and then choose
Services &#8594; Transcribe to Tengwar in the application menu (the TextEdit
menu for example). This will launch Hesperides and transcribe the text.
</p>

<p>
You can also choose a mode, once Hesperides is launched, and rerun the 
transcription.
</p>
<p>
If you get garbage in your text editing application, you have not installed
the fonts needed to make the transcription work. Hesperides uses these
fonts internally, but you have to install them to make them available to other
applications if you want to use the transcription service.
</p>
<p>
To install the fonts, open the Hesperides disk image (the one you downloaded
when you first installed Hesperides), go into the Fonts folder, open them
(using Font Book), and click on the Install Font button.
